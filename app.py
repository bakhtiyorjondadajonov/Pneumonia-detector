    <p>This AI model is designed to diagnose pneumonia from chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques.

    Leveraging the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the Fastai library, the model has been trained on a large dataset of labeled chest X-rays to accurately identify signs of pneumonia.

st.write(
    "Pneumonia is responsible for over 15% of deaths among children under 5 globally, with 920,000 fatalities in 2015 alone. In the U.S., it led to more than 500,000 emergency visits and over 50,000 deaths that same year, ranking among the top 10 causes of death. "
    "Despite its prevalence, pneumonia is difficult to diagnose accurately, requiring expert analysis of chest X-rays (CXR) along with clinical history and tests. The diagnosis can be complicated by other conditions like pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, or lung cancer, which also appear as opacities on CXRs. "
    "Comparing CXRs over time and considering clinical symptoms can help in diagnosis."
