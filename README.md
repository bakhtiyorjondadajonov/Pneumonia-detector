# X-Ray Pneumonia Detector (XPD): Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays

## Overview

XPD is a deep learning model designed to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Built with the Fastai library, this model aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in healthcare settings by automating the analysis of X-ray images.

## Features

- **Rapid Pneumonia Detection:** Quickly and accurately identifies pneumonia from chest X-ray images.
- **High Accuracy:** Utilizes a CNN architecture trained on a large dataset for reliable results.
- **Assists Radiologists:** Provides a valuable second opinion to support radiologists in diagnosing pneumonia.
- **Resource-Efficient:** Designed to function in various settings, including resource-limited environments.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Capable of integrating new data to refine and update diagnostic capabilities.
